### Python code. Comandos_SQL_-_Python_code

SQL_commands_in_Python_code.ipynb creates and uses a database sample embedding SQL syntax in Python code. Once the code is executed, there will be a file (Samsung_Tecs_Projects_MAD.sqlite3) that can by dropped in a SQL viewer (http://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/) and from which is possible to interact with the database and its tables.

Notice that this repository doesn't intend to teach how is the best way of doing something, it's just the way I did it. I wish this happens to be useful to you in someway.

Notice that "SQL_commands_in_Python_code.ipynb" is a Jupyter Notebook file, so if you want to run it locally you should have installed both Jupyter and Python 3.

All of these can be found in the following links:

Jupyter and Python 3: https://www.anaconda.com/download/ (they "strongly recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the Anaconda Distribution")

Jupyter: http://jupyter.org/install

Python 3: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Special thanks to SQLite Viewer, Anaconda and all the people involved that make these things possible.
